The description shall include tests, adjustments, calibrations and necessary inspections. The sequence of the activities shall be stated as well as all tools, auxiliary equipment, consumables and spare parts that may be needed. If necessary, references to detailed technical information (e.g. performance and operational data) in other parts of the manual shall be made. \n\nOperating instructions \nStart, normal operation, stop and emergency stop The information shall be given in a logical sequence and shall include all operations and observations which the operator shall undertake. These may be:\n - Check list for prestart preparations\n - Prestart settings and precautions\n - The starting sequence shall include all modes of operation (manual, automatic, remote control, etc.)\n - Observations which shall be made during the starting sequence\n - Precautions concerning interruption of the starting sequence\n - Operations and observations during normal operation\n - Normal stop\n - Emergency stop\n - Start after emergency stop \n\nDisturbance of operation \nDescription of the various forms of disturbance of operation that may occur, how they can be identified and the consequences they may have for the operation, shall be given. \n\nCorrective measures \nA description shall be available of the necessary actions after a disturbance has occurred.

However the supplier shall keep and upon request provide instructions concerning overhaul and repairs at special shops. If agreed, the supplier shall also keep all documentation for modification or rebuilding of the equipment. \n\nFault finding and correction of irregularities\n For heavy machinery, complicated equipment or if the equipment is considered critical for the total operation of the plant, the supplier shall include a fault finding diagram in his documentation. The diagram shall list possible faults and irregularities, and refer to possible causes. The diagram shall cover faults which may be discovered during operation and maintenance. Furthermore it shall be described how the fault is to be corrected, if necessary by referring to other maintenance instructions.

The SRS shall focus on main requirements and performance parameters of the SIS while references are made to other documents in order to accomplish a complete overview of all SIS properties.\n\n\nSIL Compliance Report.\n\nThis report including Calculation and Data Dossier (CDD), shall describe methodologies, all data sources applied, calculations and reporting the status of each SIS conformance with main requirements. \n\n\nFunctional Safety Assessment reports. \n\nFSA shall be planned, performed and reported at the relevant project stages as indicated by IEC 61511.\n\nMiscellaneous SIS specific information, examples: \n - Premises for SIS operating and maintenance activities. \n - Identify particular prerequisites and assumptions made as part of SIS design which has to be complied with during the phase of operating the SIS. This shall also include description and procedures of required proof testing (to be prepared prior to and verified during commissioning, readily available to incorporate in plant maintenance program). \n - Guideline for delivery of suppliers SIL documentation (e.g. IEC 61508 compliance certificate, Safety Manual). See also 5.186 SR-2740 Supplier SIL documentation. \n - Reports from the various validation and verification activities including Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) and Site Acceptance test (SAT), a SIS validation record normally issued upon completion of the engineering (by system integrator). \n\n\nFormats for calculation files:\nReports: DOC+ PDF.\nCalculation files (LOPA, SRS, SIL compliance including CDD): Excel (+TBA if commercial software applied)",
