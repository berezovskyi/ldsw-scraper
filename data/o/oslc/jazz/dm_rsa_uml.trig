A property related by memberEnd or its specializations to an association represents an end of the association. The type of the property is the type of the end of the association. A property represents a set of instances that are owned by a containing classifier instance. A property has the capability of being a deployment target in a deployment relationship. This enables modeling the deployment to hierarchical nodes that have properties functioning as internal parts. Property represents a declared state of one or more instances in terms of a named relationship to a value or values. When a property is an attribute of a classifier, the value or values are related to the instance of the classifier by being held in slots of the instance. When a property is an association end, the value or values are related to the instance or instances at the other end(s) of the association.
