   Ontology for Certificates and crypto stuff.
   This is in development. 
   Some other ontologies to look at:
     * http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/crypto
        + has cwm builtins: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/Trust
        - a bit old perhaps. It imports daml+oil
        - would help to be more completely specified
        - uses literals as subjects a little liberally, which makes this a 
        bit difficult to work with frameworks that don't permit this
     * http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/
        - limited very much to PGP (though on can map PGP to X509)
        - a little coarse grained, mixes up the PGP certificate with the PGP
          public key
     *
   Todo: 
     - add some classes and relations for DSA
     - should this all be in one file? Or should this be cut up a little? Say one file for the general CERT ontology, and then files for RSA, DSA, PGP, etc... Or perhaps it does not really matter?
     - expand more on the certification side of things
     - verify this by security experts
     - owl2 has some constructs for combined inverse functional properties. 
       This may be useful to use in defining an RSA key which is identified
       by two numbers.
     - also create html version of the spec by using this as a template.
     - should comments such as this be in html?

 This will allow people to make an ascii - better yet a UTF-8 - picture of their public key when publishing it on the web.

  <blockquote>
   This specification defines the ds:CryptoBinary simple type for representing arbitrary-length integers (e.g. \"bignums\") in XML as octet strings. The integer value is first converted to a \"big endian\" bitstring. The bitstring is then padded with leading zero bits so that the total number of bits == 0 mod 8 (so that there are an integral number of octets). If the bitstring contains entire leading octets that are zero, these are removed (so the high-order octet is always non-zero).
  </blockquote>
 <p>The only difference is that the octet string is then encoded using either xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary. Currently for all usages of this relation, the xsd:hexBinary datatype should be used until the SPARQL working group specifies specifies in its <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-entailment/#DEntRegime\">D-Entailment</a> that those two types are equivalent.</p>
 <p>It would have been better had there been a hexInteger datatype that was standard and supported by all tools.</p>
